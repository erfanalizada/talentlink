what Dockerfile and nginx.conf files does is the following:

Copies your talentlink_frontend folder into /app/ inside the build container.

Switches working dir into /app/talentlink_frontend.

Runs flutter build web --release, which creates /app/talentlink_frontend/build/web.

Copies that into /usr/share/nginx/html of the Nginx container.

Nginx serves it on port 80.
